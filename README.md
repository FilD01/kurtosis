# Kurtosis

Super-snappy tool for power users of [KU Leuven Reservation Tool (KURT)](http://www.kuleuven.be/kurt) built by students. Easily view the availability of seats and rooms in Agora, Erasmushuis, CBA, EBIB and other KU Leuven libraries.

## Is it affiliated with KU Leuven?

No, this is a student project and is not affiliated with KU Leuven.

## Is it allowed to use it?

Kind of. The tool is not officially supported by KU Leuven, so we cannot guarantee that it will always work. While we shared this tool with KURT staff and (as of the time of writing) they didn't have any objections, it is by no means approved/endorsed by KU Leuven. We ask that you use it responsibly and do not abuse it. We are not responsible for any consequences of using this tool.

## How do I use it?

To use the tool you will need:

- A working R-number, U-number, or B-number (find it on your student card labeled as `Gebruikersnaam`)
- An active KU Leuven account (you need to be a student, staff member, or guest)

Go to [kurtosis.breitburg.com](https://kurtosis.breitburg.com), select a library, select a date (within the 7 days), enter your R-number, U-number, or B-number and click "Fetch".

## Do you log my R-number?

No, we don't. The R-number, U-number, or B-number is only used to fetch the data from KURT and is only stored in your browser for your convenience. We don't store it on our servers or log it in any way.
